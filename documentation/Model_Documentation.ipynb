    "Apache Spark is a cluster-based, open-source computing system mainly useful for working with very large data sets. Parallel computing and fault tolerance are built-in features of Spark architecture. Spark Core is the main component of Spark and provides general purpose data processing functions over a cluster of machines. Additional components built on top of Spark Core bring more functionality such as machine learning.\n",

    "It means a classification task with more than two classes; e.g., classify a set of images of fruits which may be oranges, apples, or pears. Multiclass classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to one and only one label: a fruit can be either an apple or a pear but not both at the same time.\n",

    "An artificial neural network is a mathematical model with a variety of applications in science and technology. In particular, ANNs can be used to solve the classification problem introduced above. Different types of ANNs exist. Multilayer Perceptron is a particular type of ANN. Spark MLlib library provides an API for a classifier called Multilayer Perceptron Classifier (MLPC) built on Multilayer Perceptron. A schematic representation of an MLPC consisting of multiple inputs and a single output, which will be used in our example, is shown below."
